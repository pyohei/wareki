# Wareki(Japanese Era name) formatted with YAML

This is configuration of wareki(Japanese Era name).
I create it from [Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%83%E5%8F%B7%E4%B8%80%E8%A6%A7_(%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC)).

# Attention

As above, I create it from Wikipedia.
And the information may be wrong.

I don’t mention whether the date is Gregorian or Julian calendar.
However Japan also had old style date, I don’t also care it.
(I will fix these problem some day. )
